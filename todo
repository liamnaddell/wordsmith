I tried the docs from https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/crypto/api-rng.html, because I wanted to write a kernel module that generates random bytes.
	Problem 1: The header is missing

Problem 2: rust docs not found
	Sol: https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/macro.container_of.html

Problem 3: Gentoo always has a driver crash on boot :thinky:

Problem 4: Completely random hack to reset the RNG, totally undocumented

Problem 5: crypto RNG api inline strs say 0 = success, but docs say = 0 no bytes generated
